**Come Join Us for Code & Coffee!**

Code & Coffee is an opportunity for you to practice your skills, make new friends, and get help if you need it. Bring your laptop, your recent projects, and your programming problems! (If you don't have a project or are looking for your next one, we've listed some ideas below.) Or just come to get to know us and ask any questions you may have about Girl Develop It!

These events are relaxed and informal and are a way for our community to come together to provide each other with ongoing support and feedback. Feel free to come for the full time or drop in whenever you can -- there's no agenda.

All are welcome regardless of gender or skill level or if you've attended past Girl Develop It events.

We can't wait to see you!

**NOTE**

All GDI events require that all participants abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://www.girldevelopit.com/code-of-conduct).
